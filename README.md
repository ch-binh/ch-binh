# Hey there! I'm Binh 

I’m an **embedded systems and IoT enthusiast** who loves building, breaking, and optimizing things—one line of firmware at a time. Passionate about **low-power Bluetooth, wearables, and self-sustaining smart systems**, I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software.  

## 🔧 What I Do  
- 🛠 **Firmware & Embedded Development** – Crafting efficient, real-time code for microcontrollers and SoCs.  
- 📡 **Wireless Communication** – BLE, UART, and cloud-connected IoT solutions.  
- ⚡ **Low-Power Optimization** – Squeezing performance while saving every µA.  
- 🌞 **Renewable Energy & Sustainability** – Exploring solar-powered smart tech.  

## 🚀 What I'm Up To  
- **Hacking away** at embedded systems, learning Assembly, and fine-tuning Bluetooth stacks.  
- **Building** a GUI for USB-UART communication (maybe with cloud integration).  
- **Experimenting** with self-sustaining IoT and solar energy projects.  

## 🤝 Let's Connect!  
💬 Open to **collaborations and open-source contributions**!
